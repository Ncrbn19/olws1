                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, Im Likha Datiles, the eldest child of my parents.<br>
                   I have two siblings named Kristoffer Jake Alcantara and Sarah Jane Alcantara, they were older than me<br>
                   I know that you're wondering that they have a different surname than me, well is that because they have the same father,<br>
                   while I have different, that's why their surname is "Alcantara",<br>
                   even though were just half brother and sister they were treating me well.<br>
                   and it gives me more reason to be grateful for what God gave to me even were not complete anymore.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   I lived in Cainta Rizal with my Aunt and my Cousin because I don't have parents anymore,<br>
                   my mom died two years ago in January 2020.<br>
                   And now I am living my life to the fullest even though sometimes I feel sad about what happened,<br>
                   but that does not make me stop enjoying every single part of my life and offer it to the Lord.<br>
                   I have everything that I want and I'm contented with it.</p>
